Steps to get a speaker ready for a streaming session

## Scheduling
Once speaker agrees to a date and time, do the following:
-	Update Trello with speaker and session information
-	Request picture and bio from the speaker
-	Request speaker’s Skype username 
-	Send a meeting invite to the speaker.  The meeting should start 15 minutes before the scheduled event, to give the speaker time to get setup and do a quick tech check.
-	Send an email to the speaker with instructions and technical details (see below)

## Speaker logistics for the event
We will use Skype to capture the speaker’s video and screen share.  The host will pull the different feeds together and stream them to YouTube.  The speaker should have access to:
-	Skype ([Windows Desktop version](https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/download-skype-for-desktop/))
-	Webcam, preferably at least 720p in resolution.
-	Microphone & headphones.  We discourage the use of microphones built-in to the speaker’s laptop.

## Speaker Tips and Guidelines

* Use an external mouse. Don't use a laptop touchpad or in-built mouse. The physical clicking can be _very_ loud on the audio.
* Use a headset or external microphone. Using a laptop mic can sound echo-y and "noisy".
* Check the Skype chat for questions throughout the presentation. 
* Be aware of the time. Talks should be kept under 60 minutes. 

## Preparing for the event
### The night before the event: Create a Future steam on YouTube and setup OBS
-	Copy the steaming key and add it to OBS
-	Update the Scene labels with speaker and host name
### 15 minutes before the event: Start a Skype call with the speaker and run a tech check:
-	Check video
-	Check audio
-	Check screenshare
-	While running the test, update OBS to capture correct feeds from Skype
### 5 minutes before the event: 
-	Start the Stream Timer
-	Prepare the transition
-	Start on time
-	Have fun!
